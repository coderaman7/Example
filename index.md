# Git Example

## Intialize the Project

We use `git init` command

## To Add any file to Git Repo

We use `git add <filename.extension>` or `git add .`.

## To Commit about why we have implimented those changes 

We use `git commit -m "Reason about the change"`.

// After Creating the Online Git Repo ( at Infosys Github Management Tool )

## To Map the Repo to our local Folder

We use `git remote add origin <URL OBTAINED FROM THE ONLINE REPO MANAGEMENT TOOL>`

## To Push all the Updates and code to the Repo

We use `git push` but if we're doing it for the first time then we have to use `git push -u origin main`
